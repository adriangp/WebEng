# REST Server (standalone)
This project contains a demonstration of a web service build with [JAX-RS](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/giepu.html)
that can run standalone. That is, it does not require to be deployed in a server. 

Run the code with ```gradle server``` and then navigate to [http://localhost:8081/tasks](http://localhost:8081/tasks) to 
get all the tasks that are now managed by the server (default).
